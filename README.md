# osx_desktop_image_changer

## motivation

I couldn't find any tools to set the image on all spaces in 10.13 or 10.14.

## usage

```
# single image on all spaces
./change_desktop_on_all_spaces.py img1

# different images
# - cycles through specified images
./change_desktop_on_all_spaces.py img1 img2 img3 img4 ... img999999
```
